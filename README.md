# BeTPA

###### This branch is for Craftbukkit b1.2_01.

A somewhat simple TPA (Teleport Request) plugin for Minecraft Beta! Probably supports other versions too...  

> [!WARNING]  
> If you are using b1.3, you might see a warning message about the plugin's main class constructor, this won't be fixed for this backport.
